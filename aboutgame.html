        <div class="about">
            BREADSKATE as a game was born on July 25th, 2020. Originally a joke game built around meme, "suggested" by Jameskii.
            As the game grew I started learning a lot of new stuff on gamedev. Breadskate was my first project development process of which felt "fluid" for me, as I already had all the base gamedev skills needed by that time.
            <div class="space"></div>
            BREADSKATE is a PC game made with Unity. Focused on Singleplayer, but Multiplayer mode was in my mind since the first iterations of breadskate (even first gameplay tests were multiplayer tests). The Demo is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677720/BREADSKATE">Steam</a>.
